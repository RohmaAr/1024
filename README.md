# 1024_c
A simple c++ console game similar to the mobile game 1024. Starts with a 4x4 grid with 1's at 2 random cells, user enters r for right, l for left, u for up, d for down movement and adding similar adjacent numbers. Any cell reaches 1024, you win. All cells are full with no more moves possible but none is 1024, you lose.

Used simple logic for movement and adding cells. 
Rand() used. system("cls") used for clearing screen which may not work in some systems.
